## Overview

Robotic perception is crucial for enabling robots to interpret and interact with their environment. This project focuses on the integration of various software tools and methodologies to process sensory data, calibrate equipment, and implement perception algorithms that facilitate autonomous decision-making.

## Project Objectives

- Implement camera and sensor calibration techniques to ensure accurate data acquisition.
- Develop image processing algorithms for feature extraction and object recognition.
- Integrate ROS for real-time data handling and system communication.
- Utilize machine learning models to enhance perception capabilities.
- Validate the perception system through simulation and real-world testing.

## System Architecture

The system comprises the following components:

- **Sensors**: Cameras and other sensory devices for environmental data collection.
- **ROS Framework**: Manages communication between different system components.
- **Processing Units**: Utilize Python and MATLAB for data processing and analysis.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Enhance perception through learned patterns and predictions.

## Methodology

1. **Calibration**: Perform intrinsic and extrinsic calibration of cameras and sensors to correct distortions and align coordinate frames.
2. **Data Acquisition**: Collect sensory data using calibrated equipment under various environmental conditions.
3. **Image Processing**: Apply filters, edge detection, and segmentation techniques to extract meaningful features from raw data.
4. **Integration**: Combine processed data within the ROS framework to enable cohesive system operation.
5. **Validation**: Test the perception system in simulated environments and real-world scenarios to assess performance and reliability.

## Applications
